### Generic Solution Overview
Named Entity Recognition (NER):
Use an NLP library (like spaCy) to identify entities such as products, locations, brands, etc., without hardcoding them.

Keyword Weighting with Term Importance:
Apply TF-IDF or BM25 scoring (built into Elasticsearch) to automatically weigh rare, meaningful terms more heavily than common words.

Semantic Embeddings (Optional for Advanced Matching):
Use pre-trained sentence transformers (like Sentence-BERT) to capture semantic similarity between queries.

### Entity Extraction with spaCy (Generic Approach)

```
import spacy
from nltk import word_tokenize

# Load spaCy's small English model
nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

def extract_labels(query):
    doc = nlp(query.lower())
    entities = [ent.text for ent in doc.ents if ent.label_ in ["PRODUCT", "ORG", "GPE"]]
    
    # Fallback to nouns if no entities detected
    if not entities:
        tokens = word_tokenize(query)
        entities = [token for token in tokens if token.isalpha()]
    
    return entities
```


Example:
Input: "Where can I buy a PS4?"
â†’ Labels: ["PS4"] (PRODUCT)
Input: "How do I get a Gameboy?"
â†’ Labels: ["Gameboy"] (PRODUCT)
Input: "Where can I rent a car in Paris?"
â†’ Labels: ["car", "Paris"] (PRODUCT, GPE)



### Elasticsearch Query with BM25 (No Hardcoded Boosting)

Elasticsearchâ€™s BM25 algorithm (default for full-text search) automatically gives higher relevance to rare, meaningful terms.

```
query = {
    "query": {
        "bool": {
            "must": [
                {"match": {"labels": label}} for label in labels
            ],
            "minimum_should_match": 1
        }
    }
}
```

Why BM25 Works Here:
Rare terms like "PS4" or "Gameboy" have higher weight.
Common words like "buy" or "get" have minimal impact.
No manual boosts needed.


### (Optional) Semantic Matching with Sentence Transformers

For even smarter matching, use Sentence-BERT to compute semantic similarity between the user query and cached questions.

```
from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer, util

# Load the model
model = SentenceTransformer('paraphrase-MiniLM-L6-v2')

# Compare similarity
def semantic_similarity(query1, query2):
    embeddings = model.encode([query1, query2])
    score = util.cos_sim(embeddings[0], embeddings[1])
    return score.item()  # Returns similarity score between 0 and 1

```

How to Use:
Compare new queries with cached queries or indexed documents.
Use a similarity threshold (e.g., 0.8) to determine if theyâ€™re the same intent.


ðŸ’¡ Final Workflow Summary
Extract key entities with spaCy (fallback to important nouns if needed).
Query Elasticsearch using BM25 scoring for relevance.
(Optional) Apply semantic similarity scoring for ambiguous cases.
Retrieve cached answers from Redis or compute and store them if not found.
